# StatefulSet

StatefulSet is a Kubernetes controller that manages the deployment and scaling of stateful applications. It is similar to a Deployment, but provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of Pods. StatefulSets are commonly used to run distributed applications that require stable network identities and persistent storage, such as databases or key-value stores. Each Pod created by a StatefulSet has a unique hostname and stable network identity, allowing the application to maintain state across Pod restarts or rescheduling. StatefulSets also support ordered scaling and rolling updates.

The following are the responsibilities of a StatefulSet in Kubernetes:

Dynamicaly create pvcs

Manages the deployment and scaling of stateful applications.
Ensures ordered and unique creation of Pods.
Provides stable network identities and hostnames for each Pod.
Supports persistent storage for stateful applications.
Facilitates stateful application updates and rolling updates.
Allows for ordered scaling of stateful applications.
Handles Pod rescheduling and restarts while maintaining state.
