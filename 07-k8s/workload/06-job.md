# job

In Kubernetes, a job is a Kubernetes resource object that runs a specified number of instances of a pod and ensures that a specified number of them successfully terminate. Jobs are used to run batch or intermittent tasks in a cluster, such as running a container to completion or running a container at a regular interval.

A job creates one or more pods and tracks their execution. It ensures that a specified number of pods successfully terminate before considering the job as complete. If any pods fail, Kubernetes automatically restarts them until they succeed or reach a specified limit.

Jobs are often used for tasks like data processing, backups, migrations, or running scheduled jobs.
