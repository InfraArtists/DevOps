# Kubernetes Functionalities

Kubernetes is a powerful, widely-used orchestration tool designed to manage containerized applications across a cluster of machines. It provides several functionalities that enable the deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at the core functionalities of Kubernetes:

1. **Automated Scheduling**:
   - Kubernetes scheduler automatically assigns containers to nodes based on resource availability, constraints, affinity specifications, data locality, and more, optimizing for resource use and workload performance.

2. **Self-healing**:
   - Kubernetes constantly monitors the state of nodes and containers. If a container fails, Kubernetes restarts it automatically. If a node fails, the containers running on that node are automatically moved and restarted on other nodes.

3. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Kubernetes can automatically scale applications up or down based on the demand observed through metrics you define, such as CPU usage or other custom metrics.

4. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**:
   - Kubernetes can expose a container using a DNS name or its own IP address. If there is high traffic to a set of containers, Kubernetes is able to load balance and distribute the network traffic so that the deployment remains stable.

5. **Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks**:
   - Kubernetes allows you to describe the desired state for your deployed containers using its configuration files, and it can change the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. For example, you can automate Kubernetes to create new containers for your deployment, remove existing containers, and adopt all their resources to the new container.

6. **Secret and Configuration Management**:
   - You can store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys using Kubernetes. You can update secrets and application configuration without rebuilding your container images and without exposing secrets in your stack configuration.

7. **Storage Orchestration**:
   - Kubernetes allows you to automatically mount a storage system of your choice, such as local storages, public cloud providers, and more. It supports persistent storage that can be used with stateful applications.

8. **Batch Execution**:
   - Kubernetes supports batch and CI workloads, replacement of failed containers, and other non-interactive systems, handling batch execution alongside services.

9. **IPv4/IPv6 Dual Stack**:
   - Kubernetes supports IPv4 and IPv6, enabling the use of both IP stacks concurrently, which is critical for modern networking environments that require dual-stack support.

These functionalities make Kubernetes a comprehensive tool for managing containerized applications at scale, providing robust, scalable, and efficient solutions for deploying and managing complex application architectures.
