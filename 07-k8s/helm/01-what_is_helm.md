Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes clusters. Helm uses a packaging format called "charts" to describe the resources needed to run an application or service. It allows users to define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications.

### Key Concepts

1. **Charts**: A Helm chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. It includes templates for Kubernetes manifests, values files for configuration, and metadata about the chart.

2. **Releases**: A release is an instance of a chart running in a Kubernetes cluster. You can install multiple releases of the same chart with different configurations.

3. **Repositories**: Helm repositories are collections of packaged charts that can be shared and consumed. The default repository is Helm's official stable repository, but you can add other repositories as well.

### Benefits of Using Helm

- **Simplifies Deployments**: Helm charts make it easy to deploy applications and manage their lifecycle (install, upgrade, and rollback).
- **Reusable**: Charts can be reused across different environments, ensuring consistency.
- **Configuration Management**: Helm allows you to manage application configuration using values files, which can be overridden as needed.
- **Dependency Management**: Helm can manage dependencies between different charts, ensuring that all required components are installed.

### Basic Helm Commands

1. **Install Helm**:
   - Helm must be installed both on your local machine (Helm client) and in your Kubernetes cluster (Tiller, in Helm v2; only client in Helm v3).

   ```sh
   # Install Helm on local machine
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
   ```

2. **Add a Repository**:
   - Add a Helm chart repository to your local Helm client.

   ```sh
   helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
   helm repo update
   ```

3. **Search for Charts**:
   - Search for available charts in the added repositories.

   ```sh
   helm search repo nginx
   ```

4. **Install a Chart**:
   - Install a chart from a repository, creating a release in your Kubernetes cluster.

   ```sh
   helm install my-nginx stable/nginx-ingress
   ```

5. **List Releases**:
   - List all Helm releases in your Kubernetes cluster.

   ```sh
   helm list
   ```

6. **Upgrade a Release**:
   - Upgrade an existing release to a new chart version or new configuration.

   ```sh
   helm upgrade my-nginx stable/nginx-ingress --set controller.replicaCount=2
   ```

7. **Rollback a Release**:
   - Roll back an existing release to a previous version.

   ```sh
   helm rollback my-nginx 1
   ```

8. **Uninstall a Release**:
   - Uninstall a release, removing all associated Kubernetes resources.

   ```sh
   helm uninstall my-nginx
   ```

### Example: Creating and Deploying a Custom Helm Chart

1. **Create a New Chart**:
   - Create a new Helm chart scaffold.

   ```sh
   helm create mychart
   ```

2. **Chart Structure**:
   - The created chart directory structure will look like this:

   ```
   mychart/
   ├── Chart.yaml
   ├── values.yaml
   ├── charts/
   ├── templates/
   │   ├── deployment.yaml
   │   ├── service.yaml
   │   ├── _helpers.tpl
   │   └── ...
   ```

3. **Edit Templates**:
   - Modify the templates and values as needed. For example, edit `templates/deployment.yaml` to define your application’s Deployment resource.

4. **Install the Chart**:
   - Install the chart to your Kubernetes cluster.

   ```sh
   helm install my-release mychart
   ```

5. **Upgrade the Chart**:
   - Make changes to your chart and upgrade the release.

   ```sh
   helm upgrade my-release mychart
   ```

By using Helm, you can streamline the deployment and management of your Kubernetes applications, making it easier to handle complex configurations and dependencies.
