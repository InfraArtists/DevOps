# Git

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project. It tracks changes to files and directories over time, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed. Git provides features like branching and merging, which make it easier to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously. It also allows you to work offline and then synchronize your changes with a remote repository when you have an internet connection.

Git was created by `Linus Torvalds`, the same person who created the Linux operating system. He initially developed it in 2005 to manage the source code of the Linux kernel.
