### Push to docker hub

Pushing an image to Docker Hub involves a series of steps that require you to have a Docker Hub account, a local image to push, and Docker installed on your machine. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:

### 1. Create a Docker Hub Account

If you don't already have a Docker Hub account, go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and sign up for a new account.

### 2. Log in to Docker Hub from Your Command Line

Before you can push an image, you need to log in to Docker Hub from your command line. Open your terminal and type the following command:

```sh
docker login
```

You will be prompted to enter your Docker Hub username and password. After successfully logging in, you can proceed to the next step.

### 3. Tag Your Docker Image

Docker images need to be tagged with the Docker Hub username/repository:tag before they can be pushed. The tag typically represents the version of the image. If you haven't already tagged your image, you can do so by running:

```sh
docker tag local-image:tag yourusername/repository:tag
```

- `local-image:tag` is the image ID or name of your local image and its tag (version).
- `yourusername` is your Docker Hub username.
- `repository` is the repository name you want to push to on Docker Hub. If it doesnâ€™t exist, Docker Hub will create it for you.
- `tag` is the tag you want to give your image on Docker Hub. If you omit this, Docker uses `latest` as the default tag.

For example, if your Docker Hub username is `johndoe`, and you have a local image named `myapp` with the tag `v1.0`, you would tag it like this:

```sh
docker tag myapp:v1.0 johndoe/myapp:v1.0
```

### 4. Push the Image to Docker Hub

Once the image is tagged, you can push it to Docker Hub with the following command:

```sh
docker push yourusername/repository:tag
```

Continuing the previous example, you would run:

```sh
docker push johndoe/myapp:v1.0
```

This command uploads the tagged image to Docker Hub under your account.

### 5. Verify the Push

You can verify that your image was successfully pushed by visiting your Docker Hub repository online. You should see your image listed there.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Authentication Required**: Make sure you've logged in to Docker Hub from your command line.
- **Repository Does Not Exist**: This error can occur if you try to push to a repository that doesn't exist and there was an issue creating it automatically. Double-check your repository name for typos.
- **Permission Denied**: This usually means you're trying to push to a repository you don't own or have no write access to. Make sure you're pushing to a repository under your account and that you have the correct permissions.

Following these steps should help you successfully push your Docker image to Docker Hub.
